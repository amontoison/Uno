If U is non-positive, no pivoting will be performed, the subroutine will fail if a zero pivot is encountered, and a flag (see section 2.3) will be set if not all pivots are of the same sign; the factorization will continue after a sign change is detected if U is zero but will exit immediately if U is less than zero.
